# AI Assistant App

Welcome to the AI Assistant App! This application is designed to help you manage your day by providing a personalized briefing based on your schedule and preferences. Powered by OpenAI, the app generates dynamic responses and delivers them in audio format using a text-to-speech (TTS) engine. Whether you want the latest news, stock updates, weather information, or simply have some fun with a custom assistant persona (think Alfred from Batman!), this app has got you covered.
Features

Multiple Prompt Topics: Generate content around various topics such as:
- News: Stay up to date with the latest headlines.
- Stocks: Get the latest stock market updates.
- Weather: Know the forecast for the day.
- Fun Personas: Have your AI assistant deliver the briefings in a fun and engaging tone, like Alfred talking to Master Bruce!
Text-to-Speech Integration: The assistant's responses are converted to audio using a TTS engine, allowing you to listen to the briefings hands-free.
User-Defined Prompts: You can customize the assistant's prompts to get exactly the information you need.

## Technologies Used
